  - Adjusted the filter to highlight ANY exceptional base (either 24%+ quality or extra socket) and give the really good ones some extra highlight (Previously the filter was highlighting exceptional bases as long as the base is *somewhat* good)
  - Reliquary keys and calamity fragments now use the fragments visual style. The old red 'artefact' theme is reused for exceptional items with good bases
  - Added a rule for rare tablets (tablets drop VERY rarely in a rare/corrupted form and these are almost always worth around ~10ex)
  - Ongoing adjustments to the general tiering strategy. This is consistent out of dozens of individual changes. The main takeaway is that the filter will be better at evaluating drops better
  - Added an additional low tier for lineage gems in order to still show some of the low-mid-cost lineage gems (between ~3.5-9ex).
  - Currency tiering thresholds have been slightly adjusted. B tier threshold is slightly lower, C tier threshold is slightly higher.
  - Exotic coinage has been moved from the general currency to currency-artefacts. Just as a note: these are treated differently, because they drop in large quantities, only when running expedition content and filtering by their pure economic value can lead to undesirable results.
  - Tiny basetype tiering adjustments
  - ILVL83 flasks are now shown ob uber-strict
  - Changed a few uniques such as the 'Spire of Ire' was way higher tiered than intended.
  - Regular tablets are all tiered a tier lower now.
  - Many unique tiering adjustments notably 'The unborn lich' and 'Grip of Kulemac' is now in the 'T3-boss tier' as they are rather unexciting
  - Some fixes for the 'remaining tiered items' to prevent them from highlighting tiered precursor emblems
